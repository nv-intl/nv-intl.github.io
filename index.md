Welcome!

This wiki is an open source project powered by GitHub pages.

The information here can be extended by everyone.
There are two methods to contribute to this project.

## Simple Method

* Navigate to the page you wish to edit.
* Click the button **Edit this Page**.
* A new browser tab will open, leading you to the GitHub online editor.
* There, make your desired changes.
* Provide a title and an optional description of the changes you made.
* Give a name to the branch that will contain your changes. If you don't know what to put there, just leave the default value.
* Finally, when you're happy with everything, click **Propose Changes**.
* GitHub will forward you to a new *pull request* containing your changes.
* The moderators of the wiki will review your changes.
* The moderators might comment suggestions, which you in turn can respond to, and edit your changes accordingly.
* If all suggestions have been resolved, the moderators will approve your changes, transfering your changes directly to the wiki.

## Advanced Method

If you are familiar with the Console, Git and GitHub, you can edit and test
the wiki locally before creating a pull request.

The [Readme file](https://github.com/nv-intl/nv-intl.github.io/blob/master/readme.md)
