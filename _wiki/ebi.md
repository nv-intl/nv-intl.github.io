title: EBI
---

A tube that has no light input still lights up slightly - referred to as background illumination.
The equivalent background input (EBI) is measured by comparing it to how much light input (in lx) would be required
to achieve an equivalent level of illumination of the tube,
if the tube would not have any background illumination in the first place.
