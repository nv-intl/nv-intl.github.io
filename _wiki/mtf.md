title: Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)
---

The modulation transfer function (MTF) is the major characteristic how well a tube can reproduce
the contrast of an observed scene. {Photonis Document on MTF}(https://www.photonis.com/system/files/2019-03/Modulation-Transfer-Function.pdf)

The MTF is a function of spatial frequency (lp/mm) and is usually provided for a handful of distinct values,
e.g. 2.5 lp/mm, 7.5 lp/mm, 15 lp/mm and 25 lp/mm.

Tubes with a bad MTF will make the observed scene look blurry, even if the tube has high resolution.
A good MTF is usually connected to the perceived "crisp" of the image.
