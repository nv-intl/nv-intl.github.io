# North Night Vision Technology (NNVT)

A Chinese manufacturer of Gen. 2 image intensifier tubes.

Allthough the company doesn't have an online presence, marketing material indicates that they have broken the 2000 FOM barrier.
Unconfirmed claims indicate that the tubes are much more affordable compared to other manufacturers, and come with warranty.
