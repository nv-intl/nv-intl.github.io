# Military

## Image Intensifiers

The U.S. military has an ongoing line of procurement contracts for image intensifiers called [Omni](/wiki/omni).

## Devices

Over the decades, the U.S. military has issued many different night vision devices for different roles.

Night vision devices are designated as AN/PVS, which translates to
Army/Navy Portable Visual Search[<sup>1</sup>](1).

A list of the most noteworthy devices includes:

* AN/PVS-5
* AN/PVS-7
* AN/PVS-14
* AN/PVS-15
* AN/PVS-18
* AN/PVS-21
* AN/PVS-23
* AN/PVS-24
* AN/PVS-27
* AN/PVS-31

# Export

The export of night vision equipment is controlled in accordance with the
*International Traffic in Arms* (ITAR) regime, which is defined in Title 22
in the Code of Federal Regulations Part 120-130. [<sup>[2]</sup>][2]

ITAR defines the *United States Munitions List* (USML) [<sup>[3]</sup>][3] of
controlled items grouped by category.

Among others, category XII contains devices and weapon sights
using image intensifiers with a [sensitivity](/wiki/measurements#photocathode-sensitivity) over 350 Î¼A/lm
and Gen. 3 image intensifiers (or later).

Exporting ITAR controlled equipment & information without a license is a punishable crime.

*Note*:
* Restricted devices and image intensifiers still regulary find their way into the international
market by:
  * rare occurences of companies exporting legally
  * U.S. military bases in other countries selling off surplus & damaged equipment
  * illegal smuggling
* In most countries, trading and owning ITAR controlled equipment is completely legal.
* Equipment imported to the U.S. might not be able to be exported again if it falls under ITAR.
* Allthough theoretically possible, permission to legally export ITAR regulated night vision
equipment is generally seen as unobtainable.
* It seems like exceptions have been made for Gen. 3 image intensifiers with low FOM [<sup>[4]</sup>][4]
