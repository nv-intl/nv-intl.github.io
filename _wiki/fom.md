title: Figure of Merit
---

The figure of merit (FOM) is a dimensionless number used to benchmark tubes without requiring to look at different
measurements.

The formula is

```
FOM = SNR x Resolution (lp/mm)
```

The range of FOM currently available to the civilian market is between 0 and 3000.

The price of a tube is often directly proportional to the FOM.
