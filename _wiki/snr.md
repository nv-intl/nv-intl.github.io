title: Signal-To-Noise Ratio
---

The signal to noise ratio is a dimensionless value determined by dividing the perceived strength of the intensified image by the perceived noise.

The image below gives a visual representation of a high- and low values of SNR.

Low SNR tubes are generally cheaper, but still produce clear results when there is enough light left.

High SNR tubes become expensive quickly, but will produce a clear image even in much darker conditions.

According to Photonis, the SNR is measured using a 0.2 mm spot of light flickering at 10 Hz with a brightness of 108 Âµlx. [<sup>[1](4.6.11)</sup>][1]
