Photonis is an European manufacturer located in Luxemburg.

The most important difference to other manufacturers is that Photonis is producing only Gen. 2
image intensifiers, but has improved the technology to such a degree that the high end tubes
can easily compete, if not outperform modern Gen. 3 tubes from the [U.S.](/wiki/usa).

Photonis offers most tubes with two different types of phosphors, P43 (green) and P45 (white). Their P45 phosphor tubes are also called *Onyx*.

Generally, European made tubes are very expensive, with Photonis being no exception.
When comparing to prices of U.S. made thin film Gen. 3 tubes, they often cost almost twice as much for the same performance.
Some users however swear on their superior image quality and resistance against shock and bright lights.

## XD4
[Brochure][XD4 Brochure]

XD4 is lowest performing tube offered by Photonis from an old production line at minimum 1200 FOM.

## XR5
[Brochure][XR5 Brochure]

XR5 tubes originate from the same production line as XD4, but have higher performance at minimum 1472 FOM.

## Echo
[Brochure][Echo Brochure]

Echo is Photonis' standard line of commercial tubes. The tubes rarely break the 2000 FOM barrier.

Key characteristics are:

* Good image clarity
* Good resolution
* Low Halo
* Low performance in light conditions under 100 Âµlx.

## Echo+

Echo+ is the same production line as Echo, denoting the resulting tubes with higher performance.
These tubes usually break the 2000 FOM barrier.

## 4G
[Brochure][4G Brochure]

4G is Photonis high end production line aimed at MIL/LEO customers, allthough being sold to civilians as well, for example by IEA Mil-Optics GmbH.

4G tubes often compare directly to thin-film Gen.3 tubes.

Key characteristics are:
* Superb image clarity
* Superb resolution
* Low halo
* Not confirmed: Good performance even in very dark conditions.

## 4G+
[Brochure][4G+ Brochure]

Released in 2019, the 4G+ series builds on the technology of 4G with various improvements,
leading to a minimum 2300 FOM, with unconfirmed sources claiming some tubes reaching up to 3000 FOM.

In 2016 Photonis patented the use of *diffraction grating*{Patent EP2907154B1}(https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2907154B1)
which suggests a 80% increase in photocathode sensitivity.

Marketing material also mentions improvements in MCP technology. {4G Leaflet}(https://www.photonis.com/system/files/2020-06/190902-Leaflet-4Gp.pdf).
Experts have linked these improvements to a second patent from 2019 {Patent EP3400469B1}(https://patents.google.com/patent/EP3400469B1)
indicating the use of a *GaAs film* to "focus" electrons emitted by the MCP,
leading to a alleged 81% improvement of the [MTF](/wiki/measurements#modulation-transfer-function-mtf).
