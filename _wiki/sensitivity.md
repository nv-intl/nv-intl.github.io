title: Sensitivity
---

The photocathode sensitivity determines how many microampere are produced relative to the illumination level measured in lumen.

The higher the sensitivity, the easier incoming photons can dislodge an electron from the photocathode,
resulting in more electrons hitting the phosphor screen for a given illumination level.

Photocathode sensitivity is directly related to the gain of a system.
