title: Resolution
---

The resolution of an image intensifier tube is determined by the number of light points
on the phosphor screen across a line of one millimeter (lp/mm).

The effect is the same as with the resolution of a camera sensor or a smartphone - the higher the resolution the more details can be recognized.

See the [Demo](/wiki/demo.html) for a simulation of the effects of different resolutions.
