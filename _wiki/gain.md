title: Gain
---

The gain of a tube is typically measured using one of two units.

The most common unit is cd/m²/lx, i.e. candelas per meter squared per lux.

The older convention is Fl/Fc (foot-lamberts per foot-candle).

The gain is measured as a value of output intensity over input intensity.
A gain of 10000 cd/m²/lx is the same as 31415 Fl/Fc.
