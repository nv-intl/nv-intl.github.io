# Laws

Certain gun-mounted equipment is prohibited by the *Waffengesetz* ยง 2.3 & annex 2 [<sup>[4]</sup>][1][<sup>[5]</sup>][2][<sup>[6]</sup>][3].

According to annex 2 nr. 1.2.4.2 gun-mounted night vision attachments & sights are prohibited
if they include an electronic image converter or an image intensifier.

*Note*:
* Image converters include infrared and thermal.
* Naturally, attaching regular night vision devices to the gun (e.g. duct taping)
is also prohibited.
* Allthough cameras are image converters to an extent they don't seem to strictly fall under this category.
* Recently, hunting became exempt from this rule, with ownership & usage of night vision attachments
and sights becoming legal for bearers of a hunting license for the sole purpose of hunting.
This change might not have been implemented yet in the laws of the different federal states.

According to annex 2 nr. 1.2.4.1 gun-mounted devices that illuminate the target (e.g. flashlights)
or mark the target (e.g. lasers) are prohibited.

*Note*:
* This includes light in the non-visual spectrum.
* Naturally, attaching regular flashlights or laser pointers to the gun (e.g. duct taping)
is also prohibited.
* Allthough universal adapters aren't strictly prohibited, there have been alleged cases
where the combination of a universal adapter "next to" a compatible flashlight
have been interpreted as illegal attachment.
