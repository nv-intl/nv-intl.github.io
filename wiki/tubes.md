# Omni

Omni, short for Omnibus, is an ongoing sequence of
procurement contracts of the US military for
image intensifier tubes in the [MX10160 format](/wiki/formats).

Each iteration of Omni contracts has lead to continuous technological improvements and better resulting night vision performance.

The values in the table are minimums, unless otherwise specified.

An Omni IV contract is currently in development.[<sup>[1]</sup>][1]


# ITT

Apart from producing tubes for the aformentioned Omni contracts, the U.S. based manufacturer ITT also produces tubes aimed at the civilian market.

## F9800 Series
The F9800 series is an ongoing line of [MX10160](/wiki/formats#mx10160) format tubes for civilian and military aviation use.

Each version of this series is names F9800 followed by a specific code consisting of at least one letter.

# Photonis

Photonis is an European manufacturer located in Luxemburg.

The most important difference to other manufacturers is that Photonis is producing only Gen. 2
image intensifiers, but has improved the technology to such a degree that the high end tubes
can easily compete, if not outperform modern Gen. 3 tubes from the U.S..

Photonis offers most tubes with two different types of phosphors, P43 (green) and P45 (white). Their P45 phosphor tubes are also called *Onyx*.

Generally, European made tubes are very expensive, with Photonis being no exception.

When comparing to prices of U.S. made thin film Gen. 3 tubes, they often cost almost twice as much for the same performance.

Some users however swear on their superior image quality and resistance against shock and bright lights.

## XD4
[Brochure][XD4 Brochure]

XD4 is lowest performing tube offered by Photonis from an old production line at minimum 1200 FOM.

## XR5
[Brochure][XR5 Brochure]

XR5 tubes originate from the same production line as XD4, but have higher performance at minimum 1472 FOM.

## Echo
[Brochure][Echo Brochure]

Echo is Photonis' standard line of commercial tubes. The tubes rarely break the 2000 FOM barrier.

Key characteristics are:

* Good image clarity
* Good resolution
* Low Halo
* Low performance in light conditions under 100 Âµlx.

## Echo+

Echo+ is the same production line as Echo, denoting the resulting tubes with higher performance.
These tubes usually break the 2000 FOM barrier.

## 4G
[Brochure][4G Brochure]

4G is Photonis high end production line aimed at MIL/LEO customers, allthough being sold to civilians as well, for example by IEA Mil-Optics GmbH.

4G tubes often compare directly to thin-film Gen.3 tubes.

Key characteristics are:
* Superb image clarity
* Superb resolution
* Low halo
* Not confirmed: Good performance even in very dark conditions.

## 4G+
[Brochure][4G+ Brochure]

Released in 2019, the 4G+ series builds on the technology of 4G with various improvements,
leading to a minimum 2300 FOM, with unconfirmed sources claiming some tubes reaching up to 3000 FOM.

In 2016 Photonis patented the use of *diffraction grating*[<sup>[2]</sup>][2] which suggests a 80% increase in photocathode sensitivity.

Marketing material also mentions improvements in MCP technology. [<sup>[3]</sup>][3].
Experts have linked these improvements to a second patent from 2019 [<sup>[4]</sup>][4] indicating the use of a *GaAs film* to "focus" electrons emitted by the MCP,
leading to a alleged 81% improvement of the [MTF](/wiki/measurements#modulation-transfer-function-mtf).

{% include image.html image="gaas_film.png" description="Top left: electrons leaving the MCP without film<br/>Top right: electrons leaving the MCP with film<br/>Bottom: MTFs with and without film, showing an improvement in contrast with film (112)" %}

# Harder Digital

A German tube manufacturer specializing in Gen. 3 tubes that are directly comparable to U.S. made alternatives.

Tubes are generally only sold for Mil/LE, but find their way into the civilian market nontheless - at a considerable price.

# Katod Inc

A Russian tube manufacturer producing both Gen. 2 and Gen. 3 tubes with acceptable prices.

# North Night Vision Technology (NNVT)

A Chinese manufacturer of Gen. 2 image intensifier tubes.

Allthough the company doesn't have an online presence, marketing material indicates that they have broken the 2000 FOM barrier.
Unconfirmed claims indicate that the tubes are much more affordable compared to other manufacturers, and come with warranty.
