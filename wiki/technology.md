The phosphor screen converts electrons emitted by the MCP back into visible light.

The U.S. military adopted green P43 phosphor as a standard, taking advantage of the outstanding
native ability of the human eye to recognize movement and silhouettes in green foliage.
In recent years, however, an increasing number of civilian night vision users started to prefer
the white phosphor P45 for various reasons.
Many claim it is to reduce the eye strain from the prolonged viewing of a green image.
The use of white phosphor NVG's in the 2019 video game title *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*
has lead to a further increase in it's popularity.
