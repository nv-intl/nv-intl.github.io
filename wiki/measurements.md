Every night vision tube comes with a set of measurements that can be used to determine the quality and how suitable it is for different uses.

## Signal-To-Noise ratio (SNR or S/N)
Unit: unitless

A dimensionless value that is determined by dividing the perceived strength of the intensified image by the perceived noise.
The image below gives a visual representation of a high- and low values of SNR.

Low SNR tubes are generally cheaper, but still produce clear results when there is enough light left.

High SNR tubes become expensive quickly, but will produce a clear image even in much darker conditions.

## Resolution
Unit: lp / mm

Determined by the number of light points on the phosphorus screen across a line of one millimeter.

The effect is the same as with the resolution of a camera sensor or a smartphone - the higher the resolution the more details can be recognized.


## Figure Of Merit (FOM)
Unit: unitless

The figure of merit is a dimensionless number used to benchmark tubes without requiring to look at different
measurements.

The formula is

```
FOM = SNR x Resolution (lp/mm)
```

The range of FOM currently available to the civilian market is between 0 and 3000.

The price of a tube is often directly proportional to the FOM.

## Gain
Unit: fL/fc, cd/m²/lx

The gain of a tube is typically measured using one of two units.

The most common unit is cd/m²/lx, i.e. candelas per meter squared per lux.

The older convention is Fl/Fc (foot-lamberts per foot-candle).

The gain is measured as a value of output intensity over input intensity.
A gain of 10000 cd/m²/lx is the same as 31415 Fl/Fc. 

## Photocathode Sensitivity
Unit: uA/lm

The photocathode sensitivity determines how many microampere are produced relative to the illumination level measured in lumen.

The higher the sensitivity, the easier incoming photons can dislodge an electron from the photocathode,
resulting in more electrons hitting the phosphorus for a given illumination level.

Photocathode sensitivity is directly related to the gain of a system.
