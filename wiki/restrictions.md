## United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

The export of night vision equipment is controlled in accordance with the
*International Traffic in Arms* (ITAR) regime, which is defined in Title 22
in the Code of Federal Regulations Part 120-130. [<sup>[1]</sup>][1]

ITAR defines the *United States Munitions List* (USML) [<sup>[2]</sup>][2] of
controlled items grouped by category.

Among others, category XII contains devices and weapon sights
using image intensifiers with a [sensitivity](/wiki/measurements#photocathode-sensitivity) over 350 Î¼A/lm
and Gen. 3 image intensifiers (or later).

Exporting ITAR controlled equipment & information without a license is a punishable crime.

*Note*:
* Restricted devices and image intensifiers still regulary find their way into the international
market by:
  * rare occurences of companies exporting legally
  * U.S. military bases in other countries selling off surplus & damaged equipment
  * illegal smuggling
* In most countries, trading and owning ITAR controlled equipment is completely legal.
* Equipment imported to the U.S. might not be able to be exported again if it falls under ITAR.
* Allthough theoretically possible, permission to legally export ITAR regulated night vision
equipment is generally seen as unobtainable.
* It seems like exceptions have been made for Gen. 3 image intensifiers with low FOM [<sup>[3]</sup>][3]

## Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

Certain gun-mounted equipment is prohibited by the *Waffengesetz* Â§ 2.3 & annex 2 [<sup>[4]</sup>][4][<sup>[5]</sup>][5][<sup>[6]</sup>][6].

According to annex 2 nr. 1.2.4.2 gun-mounted night vision attachments & sights are prohibited
if they include an electronic image converter or an image intensifier.

*Note*:
* Image converters include infrared and thermal.
* Naturally, attaching regular night vision devices to the gun (e.g. duct taping)
is also prohibited.
* Allthough cameras are image converters to an extent they don't seem to strictly fall under this category.
* Recently, hunting became exempt from this rule, with ownership & usage of night vision attachments
and sights becoming legal for bearers of a hunting license for the sole purpose of hunting.
This change might not have been implemented yet in the laws of the different federal states.

According to annex 2 nr. 1.2.4.1 gun-mounted devices that illuminate the target (e.g. flashlights)
or mark the target (e.g. lasers) are prohibited.

*Note*:
* This includes light in the non-visual spectrum.
* Naturally, attaching regular flashlights or laser pointers to the gun (e.g. duct taping)
is also prohibited.
* Allthough universal adapters aren't strictly prohibited, there have been alleged cases
where the combination of a universal adapter "next to" a compatible flashlight
have been interpreted as illegal attachment.
